Here we present the pipeline (EOD WOD SOD across corpora) to calculate the different metrics, and in the other file we present the code in charge of running the analysis. Any other data, such as corpus and other metrics, can be found in their corresponding repositories in the cited papers from the text. An AI coding agent (Gemini 2.5 Pro) was employed to help create and document these codes.
